description: "ASDO (Algen Self-Determined Option) is the intelligent unified RPC gateway for the Algen ecosystem. As an intelligent intermediary layer between users and distributed applications, ASDO fundamentally reconstructs the multi-chain interaction paradigm through its innovative intent recognition system and unified asset management capabilities. It is not only a technical component, but also represents Algen's deep practice of the user-centric philosophy—making the complex underlying architecture completely transparent to users."

## 1. Architectural Paradigm

### The Challenge: Fragmentation vs. Abstraction

In multi-chain architectures, users are often plagued by cumbersome network switching and asset fragmentation. ASDO introduces the **Chain-Agnostic Interaction Model**, which shields the heterogeneity of the underlying blockchain by building a unified RPC access layer.

### Core Value Proposition

ASDO's core innovation lies in its dual intelligent engines:

- **Intent Analysis Engine:** Automatically parses transaction intent and intelligently routes it to the optimal execution layer.
- **Unified Asset Synthesis:** Aggregates the status of assets across the entire ecosystem in real time, providing a top-down view of assets.

## 2. System Architecture

ASDO is a highly available, low-latency Intelligent Proxy Layer that sits between the client and the underlying distributed network.

### 2.1. Data Flow Architecture

1. **Request Ingestion:** The client sends a standard JSON-RPC request to the ASDO unified endpoint.
2. **Semantic Validation:** The gateway performs protocol-level validation and semantic parsing.
3. **Intelligent Routing Decision:**

- **State Queries:** Distribute queuing based on load balancing strategies or contextual heuristics.
- **Transaction Execution:** Activate the **Chain Identification Service (CIS)** for in-depth intent analysis.

4. **Execution & Response:** The request is precisely routed to the target network node (Algen L1/L2/Ethereum), and the result is returned via gateway aggregation.

### 2.2. Core Components

### Intelligent Dispatcher

As the central hub for traffic, it is responsible for high-throughput request ingestion and load balancing. It uses a dynamic weighting algorithm to distribute high-frequency read requests, such as `eth_blockNumber`, to the healthiest node cluster.

### Chain Identification Service (CIS)

CIS is the decision-making brain of ASDO, responsible for interpreting the "semantic intent" of a transaction.

- **Intent Extraction:** Deeply analyzes the payload of `eth_sendRawTransaction` to extract the target contract address and function signature.
- **Deterministic Mapping:** Accesses Redis-based high-performance distributed indexes, matching `Contract Address -> ChainID` mappings in milliseconds.
- **Adaptive Routing:** For newly deployed contracts that are not indexed, an adaptive rollback mechanism is initiated to determine the target network through full-chain probing.

### Unified Asset Aggregation Service (UAAS)

UAAS achieves **logical unification** for cross-chain assets.

- **Parallel State Query:** Parallelizes the query of account status across all networks within the Algen ecosystem.
- **Asset Normalization:** Through a standardized token mapping table, it automatically aggregates the distributed balances of the native token (ALG) and mainstream assets (USDT/USDV/USDC), presenting a single "total balance across the entire chain" to the client.

## 3. Features & UX Evolution (Core Features)

### 3.1. Zero-Config Interface

ASDO provides a single RPC endpoint URL, completely eliminating configuration redundancy for DApp developers in multi-chain environments.

- **Implicit Chain Resolution:** Developers do not need to hardcode `chainId` on the front end; the ASDO backend automatically handles all context switching.

### 3.2. Intent-Driven Transaction Routing

ASDO simplifies the user's workflow from "select network -\> switch RPC -\> send transaction" to "**initiate transaction**".

- **Context Awareness:** Whether a user is interacting with an L1 DeFi protocol or minting NFTs in an L2 GameFi, CIS can accurately identify and route the interaction without the user's awareness.

| Transaction Context            | Analysis Mechanism            | Routing Logic                     |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Smart Contract Interaction** | Target Address Resolution     | Directed Routing via CIS Database |
| **Asset Transfer**             | Token Contract Identification | Chain-Specific Execution          |
| **State Read**                 | Context Heuristics            | Optimal Node Load Balancing       |

## 4. Implementation Specifications

### 4.1. High-Performance Proxy

The ASDO gateway is built on a high-performance reverse proxy architecture, strictly follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, and implements **Stateless Scalability**.

### 4.2. Distributed Mapping Integrity

The mapping database maintained by CIS is dynamically updated by indexing the entire network of contract deployment events (`ContractDeployment`) in real time. The system has a built-in **Conflict Resolution** mechanism to ensure routing determinism when contracts with the same name exist on multiple chains (such as CREATE2 deployment).

### 4.3. Security & Reliability

- **Non-Custodial Routing:** ASDO is only responsible for routing signed raw transactions and does not access user private keys, maintaining the principle of decentralized security.
- **Cluster Resilience:** The backend node cluster is equipped with automatic health checks and failover mechanisms to ensure 99.99% service availability.

## 5. Future Roadmap

ASDO represents the ultimate form of Web3 interactive experience—**Chainless Experience**.

- **Advanced Intent Solving:** Future updates will support more sophisticated cross-chain atomic transaction intent identification.
- **Custom Asset Indexing:** Opens the UAAS interface, allowing developers to customize the aggregation logic of the asset list.
