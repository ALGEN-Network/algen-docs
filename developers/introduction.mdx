## Algen Network

Hyper Application Blockchain: ALG leverages the two major technology engines, ASDO and Mesher, to expand the depth and breadth of its blockchain network services. ASDO dynamically adjusts the information processing and operation mode of the entire ALG L1+ L2 network through the AI ​​engine，ensuring that ALG is always in the best operating state. A stable ALG network will provide Mesher with ample verification resources and a solid security foundation for its customized network architecture. ASDO and Mesher offer a wealth of on-chain applications for various users, providing a suitable environment for the development of DApps.

Through the synergy of these two core technologies, Algen Network provides developers with a high-performance, low-cost blockchain development platform with AI capabilities. Whether you are a blockchain novice or a seasoned developer, this document will help you quickly get started and fully leverage Algen's powerful features.

Algen's core technological moat consists of two major engines:

<Card title="ASDO (Algen Self-Determined Option)" icon="route">
  ASDO is the "brain" of the Algen network. It uses advanced AI models to perceive network load, transaction traffic, and market sentiment in real time, dynamically adjusting the allocation of L1 and L2 resources and consensus parameters. This not only ensures the stability of the network under extremely high throughput but also enables "autonomous evolution," allowing the blockchain to adapt to constantly changing environments like a living organism, always maintaining optimal operating conditions.

<Card title="Mesher (Modular Interoperability Engine)" icon="chart-network">
  Mesher is Algen's "neural network." It constructs a decentralized L2 grid system, enabling developers to deploy highly customized application chains (AppChains) with a single click. Through a shared sequencer and a unified cross-chain messaging protocol, Mesher breaks down the "data silos" between traditional Rollups, achieving sub-second cross-chain interoperability and seamless asset transfer, providing limitless combination possibilities for complex application scenarios such as RWA (Real-World Assets), DeFi, and SocialFi.

### Born for developers

Through the synergy of these two core technologies, Algen Network provides developers with a fully EVM-compatible development environment. Whether you are a blockchain novice or a seasoned developer, you can seamlessly build applications using familiar Solidity languages and tools (such as Hardhat and Foundry), while enjoying Algen's sub-second confirmation speeds and extremely low transaction costs. This document will guide you quickly to get started and fully leverage Algen's powerful features to build next-generation decentralized applications.
