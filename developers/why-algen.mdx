## Core Advantages

- **High efficiency, low cost, and open platform:** Algen is a globally available blockchain platform that provides users around the world with sub-second transaction confirmation and extremely low transaction fees.
- **Comprehensive development tool support:** Developers can use a complete toolchain to build outstanding on-chain applications covering fields such as AI, social, media, and entertainment.
- **Ecosystem Incentive Program:** Algen has provided funding to many outstanding developers and will continue to support more innovative projects.
- **Reaching More Users:** Algen is committed to helping developers promote their applications and expand their user base through official channels.

## **An Ideal Platform for Innovative Applications**

Algen is a global on-chain economy that brings together users, developers, and enterprises to jointly build the next generation of the open internet. It enables developers to:

- Focus on solving real user needs
- Global expansion of applications is possible by default
- One-click user onboarding
- Easily accept payments from anyone

Algen is fast, low-cost, and license-free, meaning anyone can build and use applications on it. With its two core technologies, ASDO and Mesher, Algen has become central to innovative use cases in media, entertainment, social media, and even artificial intelligence.

As an innovation incubator, Algen enables developers to focus on improving their products while retaining more revenue. Traditional app distribution models often require developers to pay app stores 30% of their revenue. These platforms may encourage predatory practices—selling user data or demanding personal information—and may arbitrarily restrict or deny access.

In contrast, Algen-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications allow people around the world to access financial services directly from their mobile phones. This means that users in Nairobi have the same access as users in the United States, opening up previously unavailable opportunities.

## **Comprehensive Developer Tools**

The developers chose Algen because:

- A global payment network operating 24/7, running at internet speeds.
- Extremely low transaction costs (usually less than a penny).
- Robust developer tool support

Moreover, thanks to a rich suite of tools (many of which are open source), Algen applications can be up and running in hours, not days or weeks. We are reviving the spirit of innovation, enabling two developers in a garage to create a highly successful business.

The tools that make all of this possible include:

- **Algen Developer Platform:** Access dedicated on-chain development services, such as free node software, sponsored transactions, and other tools to help you optimize your application.
- **ASDO Technology:** An AI-driven dynamic optimization system that ensures the network is always in optimal operating condition.
- **Mesher Network:** Customized network solutions that provide the most suitable blockchain environment for different application scenarios.
- **Cross-chain bridge (Shuttle):** Enables seamless asset transfers between Algen and other blockchain networks.
