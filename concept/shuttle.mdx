Shuttle is an innovative asset transfer feature launched by Algen Blockchain, enabling assets to flow freely and efficiently between different network levels.

### Enhanced Security for Funds

Algen abandons the traditional reliance on the sequencer’s integrity seen in Optimistic Rollup solutions. Instead, it adopts a pioneering L1+L2 integrated design, eliminating the risk of sequencer misconduct entirely. This ensures that asset security is no longer dependent on trust in the sequencer but is safeguarded by the robust Algen system itself.

### Improved Bridge Efficiency

Algen has redefined traditional Bridge mechanisms, enabling L1 to L2 transfers to be completed within approximately two minutes, with no reliance on server-side processing.

By minimising the complexity and latency of cross-layer interactions, Algen achieves a groundbreaking speed for L2-to-L1 withdrawals. Unlike the lengthy seven-day challenge period required by Optimism, users can complete withdrawals in mere minutes, putting an end to the frustrating wait times associated with traditional L2 solutions.

### Frictionless Capital Flow

By integrating the Permit protocol, Algen ensures that its native token, ALG, and key utility tokens such as AUSD can move seamlessly across Algen’s various layers，allowing users to experience the full functionality of each layer chain from their very first use.
