Mesher is a modular extension solution based on the Algen ecosystem. Its core lies in building an interoperable L2 network cluster through the Algen Monitor service, relay chain, cross-chain messaging protocol, and unified security model. All chains connected to Mesher share the sorter, underlying security layer, data availability layer (DA), and cross-chain communication protocol, forming a unified multi-chain ecosystem. It not only solves the problems of asset liquidity and data silos but also provides developers with underlying support for horizontal scaling, representing a significant step in the evolution of blockchain ecosystem compatibility.

Mesher's L2 mesh engine introduces Algen's latest L2 interoperability upgrade, enabling seamless interoperability between Algen L2 networks through a unified communication mechanism and built-in cross-chain bridges. Mesher facilitates the exchange of information, assets, and applications across L2 networks, providing users and developers with efficient cross-domain message execution, cross-chain asset circulation, and cross-chain application development services.

- A cost-efficiency revolution: Through bulk transaction compression and a unified settlement layer, gas fees are reduced by 50-80% compared to single-chain L2.
- Development paradigm upgrade: Modular architecture supports one-click deployment of customized chains, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than underlying infrastructure.
- Breakthrough in asset interoperability: The built-in cross-chain bridging protocol enables asset transfers within the Mesher network with a latency of less than 1 second, a 97% speedup compared to traditional cross-chain solutions.
