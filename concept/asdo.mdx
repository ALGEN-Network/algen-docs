ASDO is a blockchain intelligent information routing system grounded in the theory of autopoiesis and powered by AI and quantitative models. By harnessing AI’s information-processing capabilities, ASDO catalyzes a step-change in blockchain efficiency, delivering three paradigm-shifting capabilities for public chains and building a self-evolving hyper application chain for the RWA era.

ASDO fundamentally changes the operating mode of blockchain by leveraging AI information processing and efficiency engines, serving as the brain and autonomous thinking of the entire ALG system.The enhancements provided by ASDO to the ALG network have made various expansions and advancements of ALG possible.

### AI Accelerator: from “usable” to “commercial-grade”

Leveraging AI’s processing power and Data Availability (DA), ASDO combines precise off-chain AI computation with authoritative on-chain verification to fully unlock L1 performance and realize its True Network Value (TNV). The resulting million-plus TPS hyper application chain provides stable, production-grade environments for all on-chain projects.

### AI Stabilizer: from “turbulence” to “canalized flow”

Through an AI gateway that senses market signals and L1 telemetry, ASDO aggregates internal and external data, forecasts next-period capital and information flows, and anticipates interactions across on-chain applications and protocols. It dynamically rebalances load across blockchain layers to mitigate surges and other adverse volatility. A decongested, robust L1 becomes the operational foundation for L2s and RWA-dedicated chains, together forming a high-capacity information waterway.

### Intelligent Routing: from “unguided” to “autonomous choice”

Blockchain usage will no longer be blind, unguided interaction. Acting as an information router, ASDO recommends optimal paths for users’ economic and interactive actions, preserving both efficiency and cost-effectiveness. On-chain operations become AI-assisted “autonomous choices,” realizing true financial and informational freedom.
